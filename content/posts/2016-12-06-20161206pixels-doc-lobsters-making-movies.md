Maybe you&#8217;ve heard of **[Pixels Camp][1]**?&nbsp;Or perhaps, more likely, the name [**Codebits**][2] rings a bell?

Well, if you don&#8217;t know what any of those things are (_hint: they are the same thing, with a different name because of a recent re-branding_) you are in luck because these Lobster friends of yours are about to embark on a new project that will make it all clear.

As anyone who knows about these events might guess, the bulk of the Lobsters cabal has been drawn to them ever since they started happening in 2007. A three-day event fully dedicated to technology, idea sharing, designing and building things&#8230; Of course that is right up our alley!

And because we too like to be creative and share the things we enjoy with other people, we are making a documentary film about it. It will be called&#8230; you guessed it: _**PixelsDoc**_!

It will be available sometime in 2017 (the premiere will most likely happen during the 2017 edition of Pixels Camp) and just to get your curiosity going here is a teaser for you.
